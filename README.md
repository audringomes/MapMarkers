Map Markers for Smallworld

This software enables pretty use of symbols for drawing in GE Smallworld. It can be used free of charge, but we ask all users friendly to collaborate on git-hub.
Help and documentation is available at www.boogert-lab.
This can be found in "raster_symbols/modules/core/raster_symbols_core/resources/en_gb/help/" too.
