This Help&Manual skin is derived from a H%M classic frame template

There are 3 major changes:
1. Sync of toc is done better with messaging instead of cross-frame scripts
2. Contains a drag button for the TOC/CONTENT
3. Allows change of contextid param so it can work with GE SMallworld by the variable CSH_KEY

NOTE: For 3 to work, the output have to be post-processed, i.e. the CSK keyword must be changed in the hmcontextids.js, which is generated on publishing. The script replace_csh_key.cmd can be used as post-event processing.
